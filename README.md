# Conservative-Formula-Investing

This project is an implementation of the analyis and strategies presented in the [core paper](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/Conservative-Formula-Investing/blob/main/Core%20Paper%20-%20Conservative%20Formula%20Investing.pdf), 'The Conservative Formula: Evidence from India'.       

The paper explores evidence of the [Low-Volatility Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-volatility_anomaly) in Indian markets, and how a robust, conservative formula based portfolio outperforms a speculative one. 

The [clean data folder](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/Conservative-Formula-Investing/tree/main/clean%20data) contains all processed and trimmed data.            

The input [files folder](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/Conservative-Formula-Investing/tree/main/Input%20Files) contains all raw data.     

Different concepts/sections of the paper are implemented in separate notebooks, contained in the [Code folder](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/Conservative-Formula-Investing/tree/main/Code).     

In the [pdf report](https://github.com/RishabhKhandelwal-17/Conservative-Formula-Investing/blob/main/Report.pdf) I have explained most of my thought process and the methodology used.
